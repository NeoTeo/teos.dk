	<p>In the last year i have fallen in love with a very niche subgenre of music. So niche, in fact, that i don't think it has a name. So, for lack of one, i will name this genre DocuWave.
	<br>I'll explain.
	</p>
	<p>This new genre of "mine" shares a lot of traits with the other xWave genres such as RetroWave, SynthWave and VaporWave in that they refer, through a certain style of rhythm and instrumentation, to a time when New Wave was actually new, a time in the 1980s when synthesizers were still instruments that you could tell apart by their unique sound and limited soundbanks.</p>
	<p>The main difference between these and DocuWave is the frequent inclusion of soundbites from documentary programs from that era, such as Towards/Beyond 2000, Computer Chronicles, Nova and generally (english) news or documentary broadcasts commenting on the explosive emergence of (computer) technology of that time.</p>
	<p>I'm listing here the examples of this genre that i have found so far as well as link to a playlist where they can be heard.
So far i have:</p>
<p>
 <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>19, Paul Hardcastle (not strictly compliant, but notable for actually being from the 80s)</li>
        <li>In the News, mitch murder</li>
        <li>Press Clr for Clear, Zalza</li>
        <li>Homebrew Computer Club, Command B (more hip-hop than synths but with that same computer/tech theme)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
I post this here in the hope that others will enjoy this subgenre and that, perhaps they will discover new examples they, in turn, will share with me.</p>
