	<b>Solving reload flicker on Raspberry Pi Chromium.</b><div class="right">19/11/2021</div>
	<hr>
	<p>
	<p>Recently i had occasion to create a minimal interactive kiosk device using a Raspberry Pi and the official 7" touch display.</p>
	<p>The way i satisfied my requirements was to boot a minimal Raspbian directly into full-screen Chromium displaying a specific web-page.
	Since the kiosk would be displaying timely information i needed it to update at regular and frequent intervals. </p>
	<p>The simplest way to achieve this is using the <pre>&lt;meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="10"&gt;</pre> tag for a refresh every ten seconds.</p>
	<p>To make the display less jarring in a dark environment i implemented a little Javascript to change the foreground and background colours at certain times of the day.</p>
	<p>This, however, caused an unanticipated problem: sometimes the reload would happen slowly enough that there would be a perceptible and annoying flicker of white screen before the background was changed to dark.</p>
	<p>After a few failed attempts i settled on this most simple solution: change the style tag to <pre>&lt;style="display:none"&gt;</pre><br>
	I hope this is useful to anyone else in a similar situation.</p>
