    <p>A recurring theme i have noticed in many reviews of newer Star Wars properties is that of “fan service”. It is used almost exclusively in the negative to indicate references or characters from the original series whose appearance has no weight or bearing on the story and are merely included for the sake of giving (presumably old, original) fans a thrill of nostalgic recognition.  </p>
<p>I object both to the negative connotations of the term, and to its association with the cynical practice of incongruously shoving old props out into a scene. True fan service, to me, is understanding that the original Star Wars fan is now “midway in their journey” of their life and is well beyond the enchantment of magical machinations, fantastical odds, and reductive morality. What i’m saying is that suspending their disbelief takes a lot more than just special effects. It takes subjects that they care about.  </p>
<p>In all the SW properties i have seen so far — that is, most of them — only Andor has shown an understanding of this. Eschewing mystical heroics and gratuitous use of the Force, it instead explores the issues that now occupy the minds of those original fans. At a time when oppressive regimes and the resultant radicalization seem on the rise, it offers a more nuanced view of everyone involved, their motivations and frustrations. It  shows the power of momentum (on both sides) and at the same time offers reasons for and hope against what can seem like the inevitable bad ending we’ve come to expect from reality.</p>
