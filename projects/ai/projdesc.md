# arss 
an rss reader that takes an OPML xml file of feeds (exported from eg. Inoreader) and creates an html page that lists all the articles in temporal order.
If the Claude token is provided it will, by default, group disparate posts with semantically similar content (group samey posts). 
It will also read the prompts.txt file which can direct further consideration of the posts. As an example it can silence (group under a collapsed header) posts that instigate unprompted consumerism (ads). The script is run periodically and can be set to range a variety of time spans.

# neggo
A scanned film negative inverter that allows adjustment of the resulting positive.

# timelines
This script creates an html page that takes simply formatted .md files (date and description) and shows them as vertical timelines in columns. 
This juxtapositon allows them to be compared and clicking a date aligns them horizontally on common dates. It is possible, by clicking the edges, to collapse long timeline sections to get a more compact overview of a timeline.

# ulysquot
Scratching a very personal itch, this web application (and a Playdate version) contains the entirety of Gabler's A Critical and Synoptic Edition of James Joyce's Ulysses and makes it easy to jump to a specific episode and line therein. A text search mode makes the reverse possible: finding the section and line of a particular word or passage, useful for looking up commentary in Ulysses Annotated (or any other reference that uses the Gabler index system).

# tabemas
A Safari extension that tracks open tabs as well as tab history and sorts either by time added or by alphabetical order (with toggles to reverse). It also provides type-to-search of both titles and url.
